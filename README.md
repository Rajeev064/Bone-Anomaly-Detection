# Bone-Anomaly-Detection
This program uses Various Machine Learning Techniques like Transfer Learning (InceptionResnetv2 used), Ensembling Technique. 
It also includes Hosting a model on colab using Flask and Ngrok
The Program is divided into 3 parts
1. Detecting whether a bone has any anomaly or not
2. Detecting which bone is this
3. Hosting the model

The dataset was taken from Standford's MURA Dataset. The link for the official dataset is [here](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/mura/ "Named link title") 

Model Achievements :man_technologist: :-
1. Anomaly detection model with ensembling gave an accuracy of 78% ðŸ¥³
2. Bone Detection Model achived 93% on test data ðŸ”¥
